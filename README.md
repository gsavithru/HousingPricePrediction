# HousingPricePrediction
California Housing Price Prediction
We go through an entire machine learning project to predict housing prices in California,based on different factors & variables.
We import the necessary libraries and the housing dataset from Kaggle, do data exploration & preprocessing,  engineer some custom features,build models and evaluate them.
We train & build the simple Linear Regression Model and the Random Forest Model, and evaluate them.
